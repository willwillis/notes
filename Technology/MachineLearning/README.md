## Dimensionality Reduction
    Get rid of the features that don't matter
    Focus on things that give you predictive power
## CLustering
    Examples:
    recommended systems
    Group Customer "Types" goether, Males 25-30

### K-means Clustering
    Centroid = center of mass
    re-draw lines of seperation until stoping criteria is trigggered.

# Code (for above examples)
- Prep the data (iris database) petal lenth & width.
    Drop the column with species to see if unsupervised and figure out species w/o lables


# How K-Means Algo works
I want K number of centroids. I can set high or low, need a certain point tha's the optimal number of groups to use.
 Q) how does it know?
 Loop through Kn
 look for Elbow curve - where 

Set up "Intertia" The initeria for Kmeans at 11 different values.
Set random state to 0
Inertia Tells us + We are calculating at a certain rate for k means clusters.
 **Discriminatory Power**

# My Questions from Class

Q) from an ethical perspective, what challenges are there with putting someone into a class?
