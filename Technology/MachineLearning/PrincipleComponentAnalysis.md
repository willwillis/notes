# Principal Component Analysis
stats procedure using orthogonal transformation to convert observations to possibly correlated variables into set of linerarly uncorrelated vars called Principal Components.

English:
- Take data, transform with math operations
- Get out principal components.
- THey'll be orthogonal (if you were to vectorize)they should be at right angles.
- Maximize Variance to one another.


r^2  (score) model's explanation, or understanding, of the variance (Changes) of the data.

Transform the data in a way to build a model that explains the variance.

# Sean's Explain
projection of dataponts in a sub space, XYZ,imaging we have 100 diminsions space. these are the most relevant spaces of data, where we can get the most variance. Maximize variance in different components.  This doesn't take normal distribution into account.

## standard scalar 
Scales the variance from -1 to 1

We're maximizing the Variance, but it's sensitive to scale.

Should increase the accuracy. (12:53 Oct 19th Video)

# Notes
THis is like random forest, but more "Manual".. This is faster, and the math behind it is more complicated.

PCA Discriminates better


# Principla COmponents
are comprised of the features in some funky (sophisticated) ways
